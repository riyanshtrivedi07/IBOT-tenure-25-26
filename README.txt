FOR PENCIL SKETCH EFFECT:

1)Give valid image file path which actually contains an image

2)Image should be of valid format such as jpg, jpeg or png

3)provide kernel size if needed which is valid i.e. , it should be odd

4)Default kernel size is 21

5)You can also provide path to save the output sketch image file, which also should be valid

6)Image quality may differ with brightness, contrast and any other complexity involved in quality of image

FOR VIDEO SKETCHING EFFECT:

1)Video file path should be valid

2)Default Kernel size is 21 but can be changed to any other odd number


FOR COLOR PENCIL SKETCH EFFECT:

1)Give valid image file path which actually contains an image

2)Image should be of valid format such as jpg, jpeg or png

3)provide kernel size if needed which is valid i.e. , it should be odd

4)Default kernel size is 21

5)You can also provide path to save the output sketch image file, which also should be valid
