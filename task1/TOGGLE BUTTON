//the connections are madde in such a way that the anode of led is connected to data pin 13 and cathode and resistor are connected to ground and toggle button's one end is connected through resistor and the diagonally opposite end
is connected to pin 2 and commanded such that the button state goes to low from high led should invert it's state
